  ###
  Look at the child's id and walk backwards through its heirarch looking for
  the existing item closest to its id and add it to its children array

  For example if the child id was : 'one/two/three/four/five' and the nearest living ancestor was 'one/two'

  Our loop would look like:
  does 'one/two/three/four/five' exist? - no
  does 'one/two/three/four' exist?      - no
  does 'one/two/three' exist?           - no
  does 'one/two' exist?                 - yes, add this child to 'one/two'

  ###
  placeChildWithNearestAncestor : (child) ->
    ar = child.id.split "/"
    for i in [ar.length-1..1]
      key = ar.slice(0, i).join('/')
      if @dictionary[key]?
        @dictionary[key].children.push child
        return child
